                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about
                its precise definition,
                for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of
                education is that
                the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to
                distinguish
                education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
                education.
                the academic field studying education. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority
                of primary and upper
                primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Available data suggest that in the first decade of life (0-9 years of
                age),
                gender disparities are relatively small, particularly in early childhood. Overall, children are equally
                likely to be
                registered at birth and immunized, irrespective of sex. In about half of countries with available data,
                girls
                are more likely to be developmentally on track at ages 3 and 4 than boys, while in the remaining
                countries there
                are no sex differences with regards to developmental status. And in most countries, girls and boys are
                at

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An effective teacher is the most important factor in a student’s
                learning
                67 million more children have access to quality teachers since 2002.
                A great teacher is someone who looks for and develops the students'
                talents and potential, and who prepares them for the future5. A great teacher is not threat.ened or
                bothered by
                challenging students, but rather delights in them. It is important to emphasise that the teacher effect
                is exogenous.
                Student motivation and student strategies for learning are more important than any external factor
                As the Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzeu said: “When the student is ready, the teacher appears”. If something
                must be learnt,
                even a bad teacher will not stop it from being learnt. This much said, a good teacher can have a
                transformative effect on
                learning for reasons that are fairly obvious.
